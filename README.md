Use an IDE to build the project, or use compile.sh by doing `sh compile.sh`, you can add arguments to the bash file.

Arguments must be .txt files containing scenario as seen in `scenario/scenario.txt`.
For each scenario passed as argument, a simulationX.txt file will be created where X is the place the scenario was in the arguments.
